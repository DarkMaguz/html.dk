<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defactivexctrlvbs"></A>ActiveX control</B></P>

<P>An object that you place on a form to enable or enhance a user's interaction with an application. ActiveX controls have events and can be incorporated into other controls. The controls have an .ocx file name extension.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defactivexobjvbs"></A>ActiveX object</B></P>

<P>An object that is exposed to other applications or programming tools through Automation interfaces.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defargumentvbs"></A>argument</B></P>

<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defarrayvbs"></A>array</B></P>

<P>A set of sequentially indexed elements having the same type of data. Each element of an array has a unique identifying index number. Changes made to one element of an array do not affect the other elements.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defasciivbs"></A>ASCII Character Set</B></P>

<P>American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) 7-bit character set widely used to represent letters and symbols found on a standard U.S. keyboard. The ASCII character set is the same as the first 128 characters (0–127) in the ANSI character set.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defautomationvbs"></A>Automation object</B></P>

<P>An object that is exposed to other applications or programming tools through Automation interfaces.</P>

<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defcomparisonoperatorvbs"></A>comparison operator</B></P>

<P>A character or symbol indicating a relationship between two or more values or expressions. These operators include less than (&lt;), less than or equal to (&lt;=), greater than (&gt;), greater than or equal to (&gt;=), not equal (&lt;&gt;), and equal (=).</P>

<P>It is also a comparison operator, but it is used exclusively for determining if one object reference is the same as another.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defconstantvbs"></A>constant</B></P>

<P>A named item that retains a constant value throughout the execution of a program. Constants can be used anywhere in your code in place of actual values.

</TABLE><BR>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defdateexpressionvbs"></A>date expression</B></P>

<P>Any expression that can be interpreted as a date. This includes any combination of date literals, numbers that look like dates, strings that look like dates, and dates returned from functions. A date expression is limited to numbers or strings, in any combination, that can represent a date from January 1, 100 through December 31, 9999.</P>

<P>Dates are stored as part of a real number. Values to the left of the decimal represent the date; values to the right of the decimal represent the time. Negative numbers represent dates prior to December 30, 1899.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defdateliteralvbs"></A>date literal</B></P>

<P>Any sequence of characters with a valid format that is surrounded by number signs (#). Valid formats include the date format specified by the locale settings for your code or the universal date format. For example, #12/31/99# is the date literal that represents December 31, 1999, where English-U.S. is the locale setting for your application.</P>

<P>VBScript always interprets a date literal as US-ENGLISH if it is possible to do so. If a date literal cannot be interpreted as a date, an error occurs.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defdateseparatorsvbs"></A>date separators</B></P>

<P>Characters used to separate the day, month, and year when date values are formatted.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defemptyvbs"></A>Empty</B></P>

<P>A value that indicates that no beginning value has been assigned to a variable. Empty variables are 0 in a numeric context, or zero-length in a string context.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="deferrornumbervbs"></A>error number</B></P>

<P>A whole number in the range 0 to 65,535, inclusive, that corresponds to the Number property of the Err object. When combined with the Name property of the Err object, this number represents a particular error message.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defexpressionvbs"></A>expression</B></P>

<P>A combination of keywords, operators, variables, and constants that yield a string, number, or object. An expression can perform a calculation, manipulate characters, or test data.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defintrinsicconstantvbs"></A>intrinsic constant</B></P>

<P>A constant provided by an application. Because you can't disable intrinsic constants, you can't create a user-defined constant with the same name.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defkeywordvbs"></A>keyword</B></P>

<P>A word or symbol recognized as part of the VBScript language; for example, a statement, function name, or operator.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="deflocalevbs"></A>locale</B></P>

<P>The set of information that corresponds to a given language and country. A locale affects the language of predefined programming terms and locale-specific settings. There are two contexts where locale information is important:</P>

<P>The code locale affects the language of terms such as keywords and defines locale-specific settings such as the decimal and list separators, date formats, and character sorting order.</P>

<P>The system locale affects the way locale-aware functionality behaves, for example, when you display numbers or convert strings to dates. You set the system locale using the Control Panel utilities provided by the operating system.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defnothingvbs"></A>Nothing</B></P>

<P>The special value that indicates that an object variable is no longer associated with any actual object.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defnullvbs"></A>Null</B></P>

<P>A value indicating that a variable contains no valid data. Null is the result of:</P>

<P>An explicit assignment of Null to a variable.</P>

<P>Any operation between expressions that contain Null.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defnumericexpressionvbs"></A>numeric expression</B></P>

<P>Any expression that can be evaluated as a number. Elements of the expression can include any combination of keywords, variables, constants, and operators that result in a number.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defobjecttypevbs"></A>object type</B></P>

<P>A type of object exposed by an application, for example, Application, File, Range, and Sheet. Refer to the application's documentation (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Word, and so on) for a complete listing of available objects.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defpivbs"></A>pi</B></P>

<P>Pi is a mathematical constant equal to approximately 3.1415926535897932.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defprivatevbs"></A>Private</B></P>

<P>Variables that are visible only to the script in which they are declared.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defprocedurevbs"></A>procedure</B></P>

<P>A named sequence of statements executed as a unit. For example, Function and Sub are types of procedures.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defprocedurelevelvbs"></A>procedure level</B></P>

<P>Describes statements located within a Function or Sub procedure. Declarations are usually listed first, followed by assignments and other executable code. For example:</P>

<P><span class=ce><CODE>Sub MySub() ' This statement declares a sub procedure block.</CODE></span></P>

<P><span class=ce><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim A ' This statement starts the procedure block.</CODE></span></P>

<P><span class=ce><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A = "My variable" ' Procedure-level code.</CODE></span></P>

<P><span class=ce><CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debug.Print A ' Procedure-level code.</CODE></span></P>

<P><span class=ce><CODE>End Sub ' This statement ends a sub procedure block.</CODE></span></P>

<P>Note that script-level code resides outside any procedure blocks.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defpropertyvbs"></A>property</B></P>

<P>A named attribute of an object. Properties define object characteristics such as size, color, and screen location, or the state of an object, such as enabled or disabled.</P>

<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defscodevbs"></A>SCODE</B></P>

<P>A long integer value that is used to pass detailed information to the caller of an interface member or API function. The status codes for OLE interfaces and APIs are defined in FACILITY_ITF.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defscriptlevelvbs"></A>script level</B></P>

<P>Any code outside a procedure is referred to as script-level code.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defseedvbs"></A>seed</B></P>

<P>An initial value used to generate pseudorandom numbers. For example, the Randomize statement creates a seed number used by the Rnd function to create unique pseudorandom number sequences.</P>



<P class="label"><B><A NAME="defstringcomparisonvbs"></A>string comparison</B></P>

<P>A comparison of two sequences of characters. Unless specified in the function making the comparison, all string comparisons are binary. In English, binary comparisons are case-sensitive; text comparisons are not.</P>
